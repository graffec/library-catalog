# library-catalog
<p> This application allows the user to keep track of their personal bookshelf. The user enters a book's title, author, and genre and has the ability to remove entries. The books are displayed through a table, and the user has the ability to download the books they have entered into a csv file - dated so the user can keep track of the last time they updated their catalog.  </p>
